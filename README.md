# VoteApp

VoteApp was created to showcase my ability to code in C# using ASP.Net Core. It is a Strawpoll-lookalike and functions similarly.

Some things you can do:
  - Register and sign in
  - Create a poll
  - View polls
  - Vote on polls
  - See poll results

Possible To-Do's:
  - Add Oauth2 to allow third party logins
  - Restrict votes to once per user per x time
  - Allow a user to delete options
  - Add validation
